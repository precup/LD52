There are various regions filled with varying groups of people that you need to gain support from. What meaningful decisions can you make?

- Mad libs social media posts
	- You can create mottos and advertisements that aren't judged but are used in other dialogs. Mottos you can just write (or use precanned ones), social media posts you can fill in mad libs style
- Sacrificing your worshippers to gain a benefit (harvesting souls)
	- Spend souls to gain advertising on a specific region and social media platform
		- If you can't pay with money, you can pay with personal data, and what's more personal than a soul?
		- Can be bribed to boost your religion or to disparage other ones.
	- Spend souls to bribe politicians
		- It is well known that politicians don't have souls. They do find them to be strange curiosities, though, so many accept them as payment.
		- Can be bribed to allow a religion, ban one, heavily regulate it as a cult, or allow, ban, or heavily regulate a certain social media site.
	- Spend souls to spread visions of you
		- Direct souls -> influence
- Do I harvest, or do I have my army provide more likes on my social media posts?
- How often do you have people post? If they get too involved, they'll go insane.
- You have a variety of tenets that you can ask your followers to follow that will modify their behavior. Each should be both positive and negative, depending on the circumstance.
	- Isolate - Normal - Evangelize
		- +spread, -defense, +visibility
	- No Worship - Venerate - Daily Prayer
		- +defense, -sanity
	- Avoid the Internet - Live Normally - Live on the web
	- Issuing edict updates could cost souls, and the number could scale with the number of followers you have? Seems kinda lame though.
- Choose a target site and region each week to focus on. Your followers there are extra productive.
	- This could be flavored as sending your best acolytes to a certain area. You can gain acolytes by spending souls.
